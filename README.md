# enginedetect.py

enginedetect.py allows you to quickly identify what game engine a game is made in. The goal is to support as many game engines I can with as little false positives as possible.

Currently the only officially supported platform is **Windows**, but that will change with time.

## Contributing

If you are interested in helping out with development, you can either create a pull request or create an issue with information.

The one rule about adding support for a game engine is that it has to be used in at least 2 publicly available games.

I'm looking for the following:

- Optimizations
- Bugfixes
- New engine detection
- Better detection methods
